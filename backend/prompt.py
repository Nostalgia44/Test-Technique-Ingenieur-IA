query_generation_prompt = """You are an intelligent assistant. Analyze the user's question and decide:

{"search_web": "your optimized search query here"}

OPTION 2: If you can answer directly without web search, respond with:
{"direct_response": "your complete answer here"}

- Use search_web for: news, recent developments, current prices, "latest", "this week", specific events after 2024
- Use direct_response for: general knowledge, explanations, definitions, greetings, simple questions

EXAMPLES:
Question: "What are the new ChatGPT features this week?"
